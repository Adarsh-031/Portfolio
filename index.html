            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a passionate and curious problem solver with a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and
                data-driven thinking.
                Currently, I’m expanding my skill set through real-world projects and hackathons.
                I value clarity, structure, and purpose in everything I do.Open to exciting opportunities in data
                science, AI, and tech innovation.
                Let’s connect and explore how we can create something impactful together.

                <h3>AI Generated Text Detection in English Articles</h3>
                <p>In this project, I built a machine learning model to classify news articles into categories based on
                    their text content.

                    I used TF-IDF to convert the article text into numerical features, then trained a Logistic
                    Regression model to predict the article type. I experimented with different model settings to
                    improve accuracy. Finally, I used the trained model to predict categories for new articles and saved
                    the results as a CSV file.

                    This project allowed me to practice text processing, model tuning, and working with real-world data.

                <h3>Event Management System</h3>
                <p>This is an Event management and scheduling graphical user interface developed using tkinter module in
                    python. It offers technical features such as automated scheduling to avoid event conflicts, it also
                    allows the user to add new events and delete the existing events. It also stores the event details
                    in a json file which can be retrived at any point of time.</p>
